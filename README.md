# Wagermetrics

The Wagermetrics Trend Analyzer uses real data from NBA games and allows the user to filter games based on relevant criteria, and gives output informing the user how the chosen data subset has fared against the spread and total. This helps identify hard-to-find trends and patterns. Such a wide range of data in an easily filterable, sortable format does not currently exist on the web.

Data scraped from the web using Node.js-based scraper I wrote myself, which can be found at: https://github.com/jayspringate/node-web-scraper.
