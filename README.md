# Wagermetrics

**Note: Currently only supports Google Chrome.**

The Wagermetrics Trend Analyzer uses real data from NBA games that has been scraped from the web, and allows the user to filter games based on team, court, status, opponent, and point spread, and gives output informing the user how the chosen data subset has fared against the spread and total. This data helps identify hard-to-find trends and patterns. This specific data in an easily filterable, sortable format does not currently exist on the web.

Coming soon: Implementation of Ember.js front-end, SQL database, scraper included in project, and data from other sports.

NBA team logos sourced from sportslogos.net.

Data imported using an API created with import.io's software tool.
